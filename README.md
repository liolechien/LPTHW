# Learn Python The Hard Way

This repo contains my take on the programming exercises proposed by Zed Shaw in his book [*Learn Python 3 The Hard Way.*](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)
The HTML version of the book is freely available on the author's website (videos and PDF can be purchased.) It won't teach you computer science but it will teach you a good deal of Python. I find that it works best as a complement to [MIT's intro to CS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) or any other introduction to computer science. *The Hard Way* instructs you in Python by slowly building and establishing skills through techniques such as practice and memorization, then applying them to increasingly difficult problems.
